![screenshot](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/my-syntax-highlighter/blob/master/assets/banner-772x250.png)

An easy to use, with intuitive interface, WordPress plugin that provides a simple way for embedding syntax-highlighted source code within pages or posts on your website, without losing it's formatting or making any manual changes. Supporting 14 languages, 16 shortcodes and 36 themes. The syntax highlighting feature implemented via a [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) library.

Syntax highlighting is a feature that displays source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. Syntax highlighting is one strategy to improve the readability and context of the text; especially for code that spans several pages. The reader can easily ignore large sections of comments or code, depending on what they are looking for.

This plugin also uses standalone Shortcode-Processor to prevent WordPress from converting newlines to HTML paragraphs, replacing apostrophes with typographic quotes and so on.

This plugin is just plug and play, no tedious configurations or hacks, just install, enable and start using your new shortcodes.
