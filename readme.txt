== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Will this Plugin work on my WordPress.com website? =
Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.org) websites.

= Can I use this plugin on my language? =
Yes. But If your language is not available then you can make one. This plugin is ready for translation. The `.pot` file is included and placed in "`languages`" folder. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you shared your translation with the community. Just send the translation files (`*.po, *.mo`) to me at the arthurgareginyan@gmail.com and I will include the translation within the next plugin update.
